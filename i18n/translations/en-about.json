  "description": "The Click is a new approach in the fight against litter. Everyone can participate, any time, anywhere. Via the free app, you scan your own food and drinks packaging or litter you pick up while out and about. We reward your good behaviour with virtual Circular UCoins, which you can exchange for all kinds of rewards from our partners. We are creating a lasting change in behaviour and making sure that litter becomes a thing of the past.",
